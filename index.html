            It's time to design products to capture life and physiologic signs invisibly… usually through non-invasive sensors that don't require a single drop of blood, but just whiffs and sniffs. And when it is visible, it must be designed to feel wonderful.</h2>

            <!-- <h2 style="text-align:center;">All the data is collected… automagically. It makes us think more about Life and less about "health" and "security." Which then in turn allows us to focus all of our energy on our dreams (versus fat fingering daily food diaries).</h2>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">The data enables us to live aware of our health. As soon as our life information becomes quantified, not in having to "physically-type-in-my-daily-activities-and-look-things-up", but in a "here's-my-daily-report-and-your recent-eating-habits-have-taken-2-days-off-your-life-expectancy", that's when the world changes. But not before.</h2> -->

          <h2>Bloodletting to bloodless.</h2>
          <p>Our work is increasingly multi-dimensional (not a flat-decision space), and linear thinking human beings are not good at non-linear thinking. Seeing every variable and doing the mental calculus to orchestrate better decision making ain't our species' forte. We fly by the seat of our pants.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>The surveillance invasion.</h2>
          <p>The biggest beef with all the micro wearables is that you're not wearing it 24-7. Sticking them in your pocket is easy, but it requires a pocket (when I'm at home, I'm often pantless), I don't wear it at night, and there are always switches to turn it to "night-time" mode which then requires a flip back to daytime usage.</p>

          <h2>Life first. Health a distant second.</h2>
          <p>We're going to design products to capture data beautifully… and usually that's going to mean invisibly. So I walk around my house, stand at my desk at work, go pee - and all of that physiological data is snagged to do DSP analysis on getting worse or better on a particular timeline (based on known prior results). This is where machine learning, big data, and design crash together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Stage Zero Detection,</h2>
          <p>We're getting biome analysis, emotional analysis, breath evaluation, voice analysis, and bots are in our stomaches and blood streams and churning thru our bodies + molecules + gathering intel, and more… We are able to see disease + conditions erupt at the cellular level, not when they physically manifest so our eyes and bodies can "see" them. By that time, it's too goddamn late. If health is beautifully integrated into our daily life, so that we're getting continuous assessments on how to adjust in near-real time = step 1.</p>

          <h2>From protein to pixel to policy</h2>
          <p>Our medical records, our life records, will be available for computational use like we currently have with social data on Facebook and Google. Machine learning and prediction will vastly improve our ability to live life, to see conditions at their earliest manifestation, and give us fabulous, personalized, medical diagnostics + advice.</p>
